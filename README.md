We've been using this repository privately to develop UHK 80-specific Agent features until the release of the UHK 80.

Now that the UHK 80 has been released, this repository has been archived. The code has been merged back to the [official Agent repository](https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent), and the issues have been migrated, but the (closed) pull requests can't be migrated, so they're left here for future reference.
